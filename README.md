Graduate Project 2017

This project was developed to improve workplace efficiency. Prior to this development the organization was accepting required paperwork via
mail-ins, walk-ins, and faxes. This project was developed to educate the public on what Cross-Connection is and why it is important. It also
gives customers the opportunity to submit their annual required backflow testing form to the office as soon as its completed. There is no 
dely in mail delivery or a chance of missing forms because the implemented submission form gives the customer a confirmation.
